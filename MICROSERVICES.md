## Services

### 1. **API Gateway** (Port 5000)
- **Purpose**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Features**:
  - Request routing to appropriate microservices
  - Global rate limiting (100 req/15min)
  - Service health monitoring
  - Error handling and fallback responses
- **Routes**:
  - `/api/auth/*` → Auth Service
  - `/api/users/*` → User Service
  - `/api/posts/*` → Post Service
  - `/api/health/all` → Aggregated health check

### 2. **Auth Service** (Port 3001)
- **Purpose**: Authentication and authorization
- **Database**: `auth-service` MongoDB database
- **Features**:
  - User registration
  - User login with JWT tokens
  - Token verification for other services
  - Rate limiting (5 req/15min)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /register` - Register new user
  - `POST /login` - Login and get JWT token
  - `POST /verify` - Verify JWT token (internal)
  - `GET /health` - Health check

### 3. **User Service** (Port 3002)
- **Purpose**: User profile management
- **Database**: `user-service` MongoDB database
- **Features**:
  - Get user profile
  - Update user profile
  - Search users
  - Redis caching (10min for profiles)
  - Rate limiting (30 searches/min)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /me` - Get current user profile
  - `PUT /me` - Update profile
  - `GET /search?q=query` - Search users
  - `GET /:userId` - Get user by ID (internal)
  - `GET /health` - Health check

### 4. **Post Service** (Port 3003)
- **Purpose**: Posts, comments, and likes management
- **Database**: `post-service` MongoDB database
- **Features**:
  - Create/read posts
  - Add comments and replies
  - Like/unlike posts
  - Redis caching (5min for feed)
  - Rate limiting (20 posts/hour, 50 comments/hour, 100 likes/hour)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /` - Create post
  - `GET /` - Get feed
  - `GET /user/:userId` - Get user posts
  - `POST /:postId/comments` - Add comment
  - `POST /:postId/like` - Like post
  - `POST /:postId/unlike` - Unlike post
  - `GET /health` - Health check

### 5. **Shared Infrastructure**

#### MongoDB (Port 27017)
- Separate databases for each service:
  - `auth-service` - User credentials
  - `user-service` - User profiles
  - `post-service` - Posts and interactions
- Benefits: Data isolation, independent scaling

#### Redis (Port 6379)
- Shared cache for all services. Cache only — losing Redis degrades
  performance, not correctness.
- Keys in use:
  - `posts:feed:global` — the global post feed, 300s TTL (post-service)
  - `user:{id}` — user profile, 600s TTL (user-service)
  - `verify:{sha256(token)}` — JWT verification result, 5s TTL (auth-service)
- There is no session storage. JWTs are stateless, so nothing server-side holds
  a session.

#### Elasticsearch (Ports 9200, 9300)
- Single `users` index, created at startup if absent
- Written by user-service on `POST /sync-user` and `PUT /me`
- Read by `GET /api/users/search`, using prefix, fuzzy and wildcard clauses
- Runs with `discovery.type=single-node` and `xpack.security.enabled=false`,
  so it must stay internal to the Docker network
- If unavailable, search falls back to a MongoDB regex query — degraded
  relevance rather than failure

## Benefits of Microservices

### 1. **Scalability**
- Scale individual services independently
- Example: Scale post-service during high traffic without affecting auth-service

### 2. **Fault Isolation**
- If one service fails, others continue working
- Example: Auth-service down doesn't affect viewing existing posts

### 3. **Technology Flexibility**
- Each service can use different tech stack
- Easy to add new services (e.g., notification-service, media-service)

### 4. **Independent Deployment**
- Deploy services independently
- No need to redeploy entire application for small changes

### 5. **Team Autonomy**
- Different teams can own different services
- Parallel development

### 6. **Data Isolation**
- Each service has its own database
- No shared database bottlenecks

## Running the Application

### Start Microservices Architecture
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d --build
```

### Stop Services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml down
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs -f auth-service
```

### Scale Individual Services

> **Not currently possible with this Compose file.** Every service sets a fixed
> `container_name`, and Docker Compose refuses to create more than one container
> per name, so `--scale` fails with a name collision. Scaling would require
> removing `container_name`, and for `post-service` it would additionally
> require moving Socket.IO to a shared adapter (for example Redis), since each
> replica currently holds its own in-memory set of connected clients and
> `io.emit` would only reach the clients attached to that replica.
>
> Horizontal scaling is a design change, not a command — see
> [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Health Monitoring

**Only the frontend is published to the host** (`80:80`). The API Gateway (5000)
and the three services (3001–3003) listen solely on the internal
`microservices-network`, so host-side checks go through Nginx and everything
else is probed from inside a container. Run every command below from the
repository directory so Compose finds the project.

### Check All Services Health

From the host, through Nginx. This is the aggregate check and the one to reach
for first: Nginx proxies `/api/` to `api-gateway:5000`, so it exercises the same
path a real user takes, and the gateway in turn queries all three services.

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost/api/health/all
```

It returns `200` only when the gateway and all three services report healthy,
and `503` otherwise; `-fsS` makes `curl` exit non-zero on the `503`, so the
command can be used as a gate in a script.

Response:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "gateway": "healthy",
    "auth": "healthy",
    "user": "healthy",
    "post": "healthy"
  },
  "overall": "healthy"
}
```

### Individual Service Health

Useful when the aggregate check reports `degraded` and you need to know which
service is at fault. The services publish no host ports, so probe them by
service name across the Docker network from inside the gateway container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml exec -T api-gateway \
  wget -q -O - http://auth-service:3001/health   # Auth
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml exec -T api-gateway \
  wget -q -O - http://user-service:3002/health   # User
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml exec -T api-gateway \
  wget -q -O - http://post-service:3003/health   # Post
```

The gateway's own `/health` is not proxied by Nginx, so probe it on the
gateway's container-local port instead:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml exec -T api-gateway \
  wget -q -O - http://localhost:5000/health      # Gateway
```

`wget` rather than `curl` inside the containers: the service images are built on
`node:22-alpine`, whose BusyBox `wget` is also what the Compose health checks
use, so no extra tool has to be installed.

## Service Communication

### Inter-Service Communication
Services communicate via HTTP REST APIs:
- Auth Service provides token verification endpoint
- User Service fetches user details for Post Service
- All services verify tokens through Auth Service

### Authentication Flow
```
1. Client → API Gateway → Auth Service (login)
2. Auth Service → JWT Token → Client
3. Client → API Gateway + Token → Any Service
4. Service → Auth Service (verify token)
5. Service → Response → Client
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Caching Strategy**
- Redis cache for frequently accessed data
- Feed: 5 minutes
- User profiles: 10 minutes
- Cache invalidation on data changes

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
- Different limits for different operations
- Per-service rate limiting

### 3. **Database Per Service**
- No database contention
- Optimized queries per service
- Independent scaling

## Development vs Production

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d
```

The `-f` flag is required: this is the only Compose file in the repository and
Docker does not select it by default.

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Monolithic (Current)
- Single backend service
- Single database
- Easier development

### Phase 2: Microservices (New)
- Separate services
- Independent databases
- Production-ready scaling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Service Mesh** (Istio, Linkerd)
   - Advanced traffic management
   - Circuit breakers
   - Observability

2. **Message Queue** (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
   - Async communication
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Better decoupling

3. **API Gateway Features**
   - JWT validation at gateway
   - Request transformation
   - Response aggregation

4. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus + Grafana
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
   - Centralized logging (ELK Stack)

5. **Additional Services**
   - Notification Service
   - Analytics Service

   Already implemented, so no longer future work: image uploads (Supabase
   Storage, via the `/upload` endpoint on post-service and user-service) and
   search (Elasticsearch `users` index, queried by user-service).

## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check service logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml logs auth-service

# Check service health
docker compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml ps
```

### Service Communication Issues
- Ensure services are on the same network
- Check environment variables for service URLs
- Verify MongoDB and Redis are healthy

### Port Conflicts
- Gateway: 5000
- Auth: 3001
- User: 3002
- Post: 3003
- MongoDB: 27017
- Redis: 6379

Change ports in docker-compose if needed.

## Cost Considerations

### Development
- Run all services on single machine
- Resource usage: ~2GB RAM

### Production
- Deploy services on separate instances
- Use managed services (AWS RDS, ElastiCache)
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load

## Comparison: Monolithic vs Microservices

| Feature | Monolithic | Microservices |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Development | Simpler | More complex |
| Deployment | All-or-nothing | Independent |
| Scaling | Scale entire app | Scale individual services |
| Fault Tolerance | Single point of failure | Isolated failures |
| Data Management | Single database | Database per service |
| Team Structure | Single team | Multiple teams |
| Technology Stack | Uniform | Flexible |
| Initial Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Long-term Maintenance | Higher | Lower |

## Conclusion

The microservices architecture provides:
- ✅ **Better scalability** - Scale what you need
- ✅ **Improved reliability** - Fault isolation
- ✅ **Faster development** - Team autonomy
- ✅ **Technology flexibility** - Choose best tools
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Enterprise-grade architecture

Start with monolithic for development, migrate to microservices for production scaling.
